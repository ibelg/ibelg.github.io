          <h2>Visualization 1: Global Sales by Genre and Platform</h2>

        <p class="viz-note">
          <strong>Prompt 1:</strong> Which platforms dominate global sales within each genre?
        </p>
        <p class="viz-note">
          <strong>Prompt 2:</strong> Are some genres more dependent on specific platforms than others?
        </p>

        <div class="vega-wrap" id="vg-viz1"></div>

        <p class="viz-note">
          This visualization shows how global video game sales are distributed across platforms within
          each genre. The stacked bars reveal which platforms contribute the most to each genre’s
          sales and whether success is concentrated on a single platform or spread across multiple
          systems. This helps highlight patterns of platform dominance and genre dependence.

        </div>

        <p class="viz-note">
          <strong>Prompt 1:</strong> For a selected platform, how does the genre mix of global sales change over time?
        </p>
        <p class="viz-note">
          <strong>Prompt 2:</strong> Do platforms develop distinct genre signatures during their peak years?
        </p>

        <div class="vega-wrap" id="vg-viz2"></div>

        <p class="viz-note">
          This visualization shows how the mix of game genres contributing to a platform’s sales
          changes over time. Each year represents 100% of that platform’s sales, and the coloured
          layers show what share each genre contributes. This makes it easier to spot shifts in a
          platform’s identity over the years.

          <h2>Visualization 3: Regional Sales vs. Platform</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="viz-note">
          <strong>Prompt 1:</strong> How do platform sales distributions differ across global regions?
        </p>
        <p class="viz-note">
          <strong>Prompt 2:</strong> What regional market preferences can be identified from platform sales patterns?
        </p>

        <div class="vega-wrap" id="vg-viz3"></div>

        <p class="viz-note">
          This visualization compares platform sales across North America, Europe, Japan, and other
          regions to highlight geographic differences in market preferences. Splitting regions into
          separate panels makes it easier to compare which platforms dominate each market.

     <!-- VIZ 4 -->
<section class="viz-card">
    <div class="viz-head">
      <h2>Visualization 4: Regional Platform Specialization (Visual Story)</h2>
    </div>
  
    <p class="viz-note">
      <strong>Prompt 1:</strong> Which platforms are regionally specialized relative to their global baseline?
    </p>
    <p class="viz-note">
      <strong>Prompt 2:</strong> What does regional specialization suggest about market segmentation across regions (NA/EU/JP/Other)?
    </p>
  
    <div class="vega-wrap" id="vg-viz4"></div>
  
    <p class="viz-note">
      This heatmap compares each platform’s share of sales in a region to its share globally. Values above 1 mean the
      platform is disproportionately popular in that region, while values below 1 mean it is under represented. The
      goal is to highlight regional home bases and market segmentation patterns rather than just raw sales totals.
