          <h2>Visualization 1A: Global Sales by Genre and Platform</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="viz-note">
          <strong>Prompt 1:</strong> Which platforms dominate global sales within each genre?
        </p>
        <p class="viz-note">
          <strong>Prompt 2:</strong> Are some genres more dependent on specific platforms than others?

        <div class="vega-wrap" id="vg-viz1"></div>

        <p class="viz-note">
          This chart shows how total video game sales are distributed across platforms within each genre. By stacking platform contributions, it reveals which systems dominate each genre and whether success is concentrated on a single platform or spread across many. The visualization highlights patterns of platform dominance and shows how genre popularity varies across gaming ecosystems.

    </p>

    <div class="vega-wrap" id="vg-viz1b"></div>

    <p class="viz-note">
      This chart compares the average sales per game for the top-performing platforms within each genre. Instead of showing total volume, it highlights where individual titles perform strongest. This makes it easier to see which platforms produce blockbuster releases and whether success comes from many games or a few high-impact hits.

        </div>

        <p class="viz-note">
          <strong>Prompt 1:</strong> For a selected platform, how does the genre mix of global sales change over time?
        </p>
        <p class="viz-note">
          <strong>Prompt 2:</strong> Do platforms develop distinct genre signatures during their peak years?
        </p>

        <div class="vega-wrap" id="vg-viz2"></div>

        <p class="viz-note">
          This visualization shows how the mix of game genres contributing to a platform’s sales changes over time. Each year represents 100% of that platform’s sales, allowing you to see how genre dominance shifts throughout its lifecycle. The chart reveals how platforms develop distinct identities and how player preferences evolve.

    <strong>Prompt 3:</strong> Which platforms have the longest sales lifespan, meaning they stay strong across many years instead of briefly peaking?
    </p>

    <div class="vega-wrap" id="vg-viz1c"></div>

   <p class="viz-note">
    This chart measures platform longevity by counting how many years each platform stays above 20% of its peak annual sales. Rather than focusing on a single peak moment, it highlights which systems remained strong over time. This helps distinguish short-lived spikes from platforms with sustained relevance.

  <p class="viz-note">
    <strong>Prompt 3:</strong> Which platforms demonstrate regional specialization rather than global popularity?
  </p>

  <div class="vega-wrap" id="vg-viz3b"></div>

  <p class="viz-note">
    This heatmap shows where platforms perform disproportionately well compared to their global share. Darker cells indicate platforms that are especially popular in a specific region. Instead of showing raw sales, the visualization highlights regional preferences and helps identify platforms that thrive in particular markets.

     <!-- VIZ 4A -->
<section class="viz-card">
    <div class="viz-head">
      <h2>Visualization 4A: Regional Platform Specialization</h2>
    </div>
  
    <p class="viz-note">
      <strong>Prompt 1:</strong> Which platforms are regionally specialized relative to their global baseline?
    </p>
    <p class="viz-note">
      <strong>Prompt 2:</strong> What does regional specialization suggest about market segmentation across regions (NA/EU/JP/Other)?
    </p>
  
    <div class="vega-wrap" id="vg-viz4"></div>
  
    <p class="viz-note">
      This heatmap shows how platform popularity differs across regions by comparing each platform’s regional sales share to its global share. Values above 1 indicate that a platform is more popular in a region than expected worldwide, while lower values indicate under-representation. By focusing on proportional differences rather than raw sales, the visualization highlights regional preferences and reveals how platform success is shaped by cultural alignment and local gaming ecosystems.

  <p class="viz-note">
    This chart shows how global video game sales are distributed across regions. It reveals which regions represent the largest share of the global market and which reflect more localized consumption. Together with regional specialization patterns, it highlights how gaming culture and industry influence are unevenly distributed worldwide.
